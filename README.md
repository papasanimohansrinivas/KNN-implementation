# KNN-implementation


KNN ipynb contains custom implemented knn code based on psuedo code

It has following functions:
                            read_file\n,
                            normalise_data\n,
                            KNN \n,
                            accuracy\t,

 read_file:
           reads arff format file to a list

 normalise_data:
           transforms real_data to a range 0 to 1.

 KNN:
      custom knn implemented according to psuedo code

 accuracy:
          calcualates how many resulsts and validation test match
